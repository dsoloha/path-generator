# path-generator

A datapack for Minecraft that generates paths as the player walks.

## Overview

This datapack will replace the block underneath players' feet as they move throughout the world every so often (between 10-30 blocks, depending on the block type). Crouching, walking, sprinting, riding horseback, or riding piggyback will all generate paths.

### Blocks currently supported

- grass (→ dirt → coarse dirt → path block)
- stone bricks (→ cracked stone brick → cobblestone → andesite)
- deepslate bricks (→ cracked deepslate bricks → cobbled_deepslate → sideways deepslate)
- polished blackstone bricks (→ cracked polished blackstone bricks → blackstone)
- nether bricks (→ cracked nether bricks)
